# LAB | Image Processing with OpenCV and Scikit-Image

## Learning Goals

This lab allows you to practice and apply core concepts of **image processing** using **OpenCV** and **Scikit-Image** taught in class.

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:
  
- Preprocess and manipulate images using **OpenCV** and **Scikit-Image**.
- Apply various image transformations such as **resizing**, **blurring**, and **edge detection**.
- Implement and experiment with **image segmentation** techniques.
- Visualize the impact of different image processing techniques on the output.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have learned about:

- Basic image processing techniques.
- The role of **OpenCV** and **Scikit-Image** in image manipulation and analysis.
- How to apply common transformations like resizing and filtering.
- Basic Python programming skills and familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Introduction

This lab consists of a series of exercises designed to help you experiment with advanced image processing techniques. You will:

1. Load and preprocess images using **OpenCV** and **Scikit-Image**.
2. Apply transformations like **blurring**, **edge detection**, and **feature extraction**.
3. Implement **image segmentation** techniques and visualize the results.
