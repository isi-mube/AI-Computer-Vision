# LAB | Experimenting with CNNs: Filters, Pooling, and Kernel Sizes

## Learning Goals

This lab allows you to practice and apply the core concepts of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** taught in class. 

Upon completion of this lab, you will be able to:
  
- Modify and experiment with **convolutional layers**, **filters**, **pooling layers**, and **kernel sizes** in a CNN.
- Understand the impact of different **hyperparameters** on the model's performance.
- Visualize and interpret the changes in feature maps and performance when altering the CNN architecture.


## Prerequisites

Before starting this lab, you should have learned about:

- Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- How **convolutional layers** apply **filters** to detect patterns in images.
- The role of **pooling layers** in downsampling and reducing dimensionality.
- Basic image processing with NumPy or PyTorch tensors

## Introduction

This lab consists of a series of exercises designed to help you experiment with CNN architecture. You will:

1. Modify the number of **filters** in a convolutional layer and visualize the resulting feature maps.
2. Compare **max pooling** and **average pooling** layers and analyze their effects on output size.
3. Experiment with **kernel sizes**, **strides**, and **padding** to see how these hyperparameters influence feature map dimensions.
