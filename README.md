<h1 style="color: #00BFFF;">AI - Module 6 - Vision Models - Introduction to Image Classification using CNNs</h1>

Welcome to the **AI Course**! In this module, we dive into the world of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. This lesson is crafted to help you explore one of the most impactful neural networks in computer vision: the CNN. You'll engage with both the theory and practical aspects, ensuring a **hands-on** learning experience.

<h2 style="color: #0099CC;">Overview</h2>

This first lesson focuses on understanding the architecture of **CNNs**, how they extract features from images, and how different hyperparameters affect model performance. You will have opportunities to experiment and adjust the architecture to gain insights into CNNs' operation.

### Key Topics:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Learn how they detect patterns and features in images.
- **Filters and Pooling**: Understand the role of filters and how pooling layers help reduce dimensionality.
- **CNN Hyperparameters**: Experiment with kernel sizes, strides, padding, and observe their effects on CNN performance.
- **Building CNNs in PyTorch**: Discover how to construct and train CNN models for image classification tasks.


<h2 style="color: #0099CC;">Folder Structure</h2>

- **`introduction_cnn_pytorch.ipynb`**: The main lesson notebook where you will dive into CNN theory and implementation.
  - **`widget.py`**: Small widget to use in the notebook and play with cnn hyperparameters (filter size, padding, stride)
- **`labs/`**: Only one lab is specifically tied to the CNN notebook, the others provide broader experimentation with computer vision:
  - **lab-ai-experimenting-with-cnn**: Linked directly to the concepts in `introduction_cnn_pytorch.ipynb`.
  - Each lab includes its own README for instructions.
